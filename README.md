# Restaurant-reviews-prediction-by-using-NLP
# About dataset
 Reviews given by the customer in text format wheather they like restaurant or not (0 indicates they don't like and 1 indicated they like)
 # Task :
 # 1) Text Cleaning
 # 2) Bag of words
     
     
     We have to clean the text data to increase our model performance and also the dependent variable is in dicreate way so we have to implement some classifaction algorithms for predicting yes or no so before implementing classification algorithms we have to go through with # Bag of words to covert text data into binary in order to split the data for further implementation process.
     Implemented logistic regression , KNN , SVM , Kernal SVM , Naive bayes , Decision Tree classification , Random forest classification.


# Evaluation
 Among all classification algorithms SVM is generating very good accuracy score of 79 percent. so for this dataset SVM is good to deploy in real time world.
